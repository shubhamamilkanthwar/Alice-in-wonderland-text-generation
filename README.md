# Alice-in-wonderland-text-generation
Inspiration- I wanted to build a model which can be act as a human when other person is hesitate to talk about their feeling

What it does - it generates text based on transcript we provide and human will say a 'word or few words. And ai will do the conversation based on it.

How I built it - I used Natural Language Processing to implement this Text Generation. Along with google cloud (collab) to train my model.
Challenges I ran into - Model is very heavy, computational based and required lots of processing power which i did not had while implementing this

Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Ai is sound like human and using pretty good English

What I learned - NLP, how to pre-process texts, vector counter, RNN

What's next for AI- talking like human -  Build more accurate model, improve accuracy, make ai become like human
